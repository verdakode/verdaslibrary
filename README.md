## Design Philosophy

This website is designed to recreate the experience of wandering through a cozy, slightly-mystical library with the polish of a modern indie game menu. The books on the shelves represent various projects, essays, and code samples.

The user interface is intentionally designed to feel warm and inviting, with animations that mimic the physical experience of opening and reading books.

## Mobile Support

The site is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining the book reading experience.
