      <p>For my science project, I designed a gravity-powered escapement mechanism that uses the principles of mechanical timekeeping. I wound a string around the center of a gear mechanism and attached counterweights of various weights to test different timing intervals.</p>
      <p>By carefully calibrating the counterweights, I was able to control how quickly the escapement mechanism would unwind. The heavier weights created more torque, causing faster unwinding, while lighter weights resulted in a slower, more controlled release of energy.</p>
      <p>The escapement mechanism was designed with a small flag at the end of its cycle path. When the weighted string fully unwound, it would trigger the flag to raise, signaling the completion of the timing cycle. This visual indicator allowed for precise measurement of elapsed time without requiring any electronic components.</p>
      <p>This experiment demonstrated how gravity can be harnessed as a consistent force for measuring time intervals, similar to principles used in traditional pendulum clocks but with a different mechanical approach.</p>

      <p>This is a time measurement project I created when I was 16 years old for Science Olympiad 2022. I repurposed a mechanism from an old victrola record player and developed a mechanical time measurement system. During testing, I used an electric hand drill with a custom gear that matched the motor teeth for faster setup, but during the competition I used the traditional hand crank.</p>
      <p>The project is about time, music, and space. since music exists as patterns organized in time— a victrola motor is the perfect device to be repurposed as a timer. perhaps less enjoyable, but the record player was broken and scrapped for parts okay I gave it a second life! as opposed to visual arts which can only exist in space, music unfolds exclusively through time, so temporal organization is fundamental. the same governor mechanism that once controlled the precise timing at which music was orchestrated on the victrola also served to translate to physical space through a wingnut and reliably predict time itself given spacial indicators. by measuring the distance traveled by a wingnut on a threaded rod, controlled by the speed governor's regulation of the screw's rotational motion, I could accurately determine how much time had elapsed—creating an non-electronic timer.</p>
      <p>The last slide shows me with my mentor who guided me throughout this project and helped me develop the technical skills needed to complete it successfully.</p>

      <p>For one of my Science Olympiad competitions, I made a quadrifilar helix antenna operating at 2450 MHz that transmitted signals with remarkable reliability at maximum distance.</p>
      <p>I specifically chose a quadrifilar helix design because of its hemispherical radiation pattern, think like a cardiod or a rounded cone shape centered around the antenna axis. This pattern provides excellent overhead coverage, is able to reject multipath signals (reflections from being inside) making the signal way clearer than a dipole, AND it uses energy more efficiently than a dipole because it doesn't point radiation towards the ground. The 3d printed housing made it super lightweight and durable. This made it a much safer bet for the competition environment compared to other antenna types.</p>
      <p>The construction process involved precise measurements and careful assembly/soldering to ensure the helical elements were positioned correctly for the desired frequency. Yay for RF engineering principles and antenna design stuff.</p>

      <p>I started the engineering club after realizing we could bring our science class designs to life through 3D printing. In Mr. Knack's class (pictured with me above), I learned TinkerCAD and discovered my passion for creating physical objects from digital designs.</p>
      <p>Using my dad's 3D printer, I made all sorts of things - from fidget spinners that I sold during the 2016 election season to a TARDIS from Doctor Who for my teacher. I was fascinated by exploring new ways to use CAD software to design increasingly complex objects.</p>
      <p>What started as curiosity turned into a skill that allowed me to create custom designs for classmates and teachers who wanted various items. Through the engineering club, we were able to collaborate on designs and share our knowledge with other students interested in making things.</p>
      <p>The local paper even wrote an article about us! <a href="https://encorekalamazoo.com/not-so-weird-science/" target="_blank">Not-So-Weird Science (Encore Magazine)</a></p>
